        <p> The notion that a website can be anything was intriguing to me. Thinking about a website as a puddle, or a shelf, or a garden, changed my way of thinking about it. It’s an individual creation and place to be original and separate from the rest of the web. It’s easy to Google search “website maker” and be redirected to a vast collection of websites that function as website-makers; it’s much harder to learn the building blocks of making a website, how they were originally created and intended to be made, and then learn to make it yourself. I want to be an artist with an individual website, making my own, completely original space to create and let grow alongside me. I also thought the “Rant About Technology” article was accurate by stating that technology is a coping mechanism and is often misdefined by society. Technology isn’t just things powered by electricity and the internet; it’s also fundamentals of life, such as making fire and wheels. Society leans too much on the internet-based forms of technology and fail to recognize the simpler technology humanity was founded on.</p>

        <p> J.R. Carpenter’s explanation of handmade web is inspirational to me. The act of creating a website completely by hand, from scratch, being described as a rebellion against corporations and the easier ways of creating websites, is right up my alley. I’ve always wanted to learn coding, and by creating my own website, I am not only learning how to code, but also applying it to something that is completely my own. It is much more exciting to see a website that has clearly been touched by an individual than to see one that was clearly created by a group or a preinstalled template. The reading also mentions how today’s society is nostalgic for a time when the internet was simple; this “simpleness” still exists today with the creation of handmade websites, but today’s society is all about speed and convenience rather than the slower manual labor that goes into creating a website. I think the cool thing about the internet and creating handmade websites is that they never have to go away; this “nostalgic” experience can and will exist today thanks to creatives who don’t mind and even enjoy the process. I hope to become one of those creatives.</p>
