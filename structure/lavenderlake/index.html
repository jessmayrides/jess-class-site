        <p>Jess and Connor live here! They live on opposite sides of the lake, but they are actually cousins! </p>
        <p>Connor likes to be outside, so this is the perfect place for him! He also likes pretty things, so the lavender is a great addition!</p>
        <p> Jess originally established the Silly Goose Garden. She loves flowers, art, and music!</p>
