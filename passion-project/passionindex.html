        <h2>Music: Exploring, Playlist Creating, and Vinyl Collecting </h2>
        <p> One of the things that I am most passionate about is music. I enjoy all types of music, but my favorite genres are pop punk and indie rock. I have been going to shows since I was 16, and to this day I've been to about 20 shows. I am always in search of new music, I am rarely satisfied and I love discovering new underground artists!</p>
            <p>Here are a few of my favorite bands/artists:</p>
            <ul> 
                <li>Joyce Manor</li>
                <li>Wolf Alice</li>
                <li>Heart Attack Man</li>
                <li>Taylor Swift</li>
                <li>Phoebe Bridgers</li>
                <li>Free Cake for Every Creature</li>
                <li>Big Thief</li>
            </ul>
        </p> I have a pop punk/ punk genre playlist that is over 21 hours long, and my indie genre playlist is about 35 hours long (what can I say, I love making big playlists). I also enjoy making many (perhaps too many) smaller playlists, whether it's to convey a certain feeling, or to group together songs that I think just sound nice together.</p>
        <p> You can take a look at my Spotify <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/jesuschristamen420?si=6284df83117b4637">here</a>.</p>
        <p> <strong> I am always looking for new music, so feel free to send me playlists or recommend artists!</strong></p>
        <p>On top of listening to music, this year I started collecting vinyls. I have made really good progress, as I've collected 11 vinyls!</p>
        <p> Here is a picture of all of them:</p>

        <p> I hope to continue my knowledge and collection of music and vinyl!</p>
